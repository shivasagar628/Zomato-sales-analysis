#Zomato-Sales-Analysis
This project explores Zomato’s restaurant dataset to uncover meaningful insights about customer preferences and restaurant trends. Using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, the project answers key business questions such as:

Do more restaurants offer online delivery than offline services?

Which restaurant types are most preferred by customers?

What price range is popular among couples dining out?

The analysis follows a step-by-step workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual insight generation using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
